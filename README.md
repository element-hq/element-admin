## 🛠️ Installing and configuration

Element Admin is a single-page application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript. It can be deployed as static files to any web server or hosting platform.

### 📝 Prerequisites

- A [Matrix Authentication Service](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service) instance with [its admin API](https://element-hq.github.io/matrix-authentication-service/topics/admin-api.html#enabling-the-api) accessible
- An domain name with a valid SSL certificate (HTTPS) where to host Element Admin. It _must_ be served from a secure context, as required by the next-generation auth Matrix APIs.
